# Financial Mathematics cheatsheet
## README

--------------
### Intro

In the purpose of a financial mathematics class I had during the automn 2017 semester, I've prepared a formula cheatsheet for the syllabus of all examinations. Since the class is preparing for acturial usage, we are using a specific notation. I had to use those special Tex Packages, [_actuarialsymbol_](https://ctan.org/pkg/actuarialsymbol) and [_actuarialangle_](https://ctan.org/pkg/actuarialangle), both created by Vincent Goulet and David Beauchemin from Universit√© Laval

### Updates
Here are the major updates done :

* **21/11/2017** : Repository creation (even though i've been working on the
		cheatsheet since the beginning of september).
		Adding the README file.

* **12/12/2017** : Cheatsheet updated for final examination of the semester. Added
						many topics such as Time/Dollar-Weighted return, immunization, convexity,
						duration, ...
* **13/12/2017** : Reformat of the README file (I've just learned how to use **Markdown**!)



### Upcoming projects

### Contributing :
* **WARNING** : The encoding of the Tex code is in ISO9 (my bad). I had a lot of troubles trying to switch it to UTF8 (from now on, I am encoding only with UTF8). If anyone could solve this problem, it would be perfect!
*  Feel free to do any corrections if you see mistakes in the formulas.
